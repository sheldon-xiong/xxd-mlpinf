# Minimal configurations

These are configurations that provide the minimum amount of fields to allow for a functional and somewhat reasonable run
of a benchmark.

Minimal configurations are provided only for the `Custom` harness type and `MaxP` power setting. If you wish to run
other harness types like Triton, or other power settings like MaxQ, please add them yourself. You can search in the
`configs/` directory for existing configurations for similar hardware.
