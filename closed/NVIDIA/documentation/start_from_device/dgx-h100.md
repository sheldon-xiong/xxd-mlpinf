# DGX-H100 System Architecture

![Architecture Diagram](dgx_h100_diagram.png)

NVIDIA's [DGX-H100](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/dgx-h100/) system supports the [GPUDirect](https://developer.nvidia.com/gpudirect) RDMAâ„¢ technology, which allows for direct I/O from PCIe devices (e.g. a Host Channel Adapter) to GPU device memory.  Each H100 GPU in the system is connected to an NVIDIA CX-7 Infiniband 400 NDR NIC through a PCIe Gen5x16 connection

Resnet50-Offline running on single DGX-H100, with INT8 input, requires to support 13GB/s for example. NVIDIA has
measured approximately 49 GB/s per GPU in our internal measurement of P2P transfers between the NIC and the GPUs.
