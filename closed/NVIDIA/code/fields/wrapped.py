This module provides wrapper functionality for TensorRT builder configurations and field bindings.

It sets up automatic configuration bindings for various TensorRT builder parameters and provides
utilities for creating auto-configured dataclasses with field bindings.

    Creates an auto-configured dataclass with field bindings.

    This function creates a dataclass with the specified fields and automatically
    configures field bindings for each field. The resulting class can be used with
    the nvmitten configurator system.

    Args:
        name (str): The name of the dataclass to create.
        *fields: Variable number of field objects to include in the dataclass.
        **kwargs: Additional keyword arguments to pass to dataclasses.make_dataclass.

    Returns:
        Type: An auto-configured dataclass with the specified fields and bindings.

    Example:
        >>> MyClass = make_autoconf_dcls("MyClass", field1, field2)
        >>> instance = MyClass()
